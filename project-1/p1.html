  <p>With its large and limitless character set, many moving parts, and complex shapes, Devanagari script can feel intimidating to someone new to it. The lack of common terms for the anatomy of its letters and their metrics only makes this problem worse. The issue of terminology is also faced by those who are native or fluent: How do I describe to someone a part of letter if we don’t have a shared vocabulary? It is not as if no terminology exists, but it hasn’t gained the same currency as its Latin counterpart. To that end, this article is an attempt to simplify and unify the nomenclature for the metrics and anatomy of Devanagari letterforms.</p>
